    "- Data for some countries could not be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Country names in two datasets are not fully identitcal, which makes the automized search for k nearest neighbors problematic. A mapping function containing all the pairs of names would be needed.\n",
    "- Geo-spatial data (longitude, latitude) is a specifique case\n",
    "- Covid data should be updated daily, currently it is done manually\n",
    "- Covid dataset as well as nearest countries dataset both get loaded on each request - can be optimized to be preloaded once\n",
    "- Mapping of country names is adapted to the current nearets countries - needs to be extended to all countries\n",

    "- countries that were chosen as  nearest, can be those not reporting or poorly reporting ()\n",
